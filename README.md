## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

### Prerequisites:
- Ensure you have Flutter installed. If not, follow the instructions here: [Flutter Installation](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).
- Make sure you have an IDE like Visual Studio Code or Android Studio with Flutter and Dart plugins installed.

### Steps:
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <project_folder>
    ```

2. Get the dependencies:
    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

3. Run the app:
    - To run on an Android/iOS simulator or device:
    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```

4. If you encounter any issues with missing dependencies or platform-specific setups, refer to the [Flutter Setup Guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) for troubleshooting.

## Architecture Explanation

This project follows the **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** architecture pattern to separate the concerns in the application. Here's a brief overview of each component:

1. **Model**: Represents the data and business logic. It includes the structure of your data and operations like fetching data from an API, saving to a database, etc. The models are responsible for the state of the data.

2. **View**: Represents the UI components. In Flutter, this corresponds to the widgets used in the app. The view listens for changes in the controller and updates itself accordingly.

3. **Controller**: Acts as an intermediary between the Model and View. It fetches data from the Model and passes it to the View, and it also reacts to user inputs and updates the Model. The controller manages the state and controls the logic flow.

## State Management Choice

For state management, we are using **GetX**.

- **GetX** is a powerful state management solution for Flutter that offers simple and effective ways to manage app state, handle dependencies, and navigate between screens.

In this project, **GetX** is used to:
- Manage app state (e.g., user authentication state, data fetched from an API).
- Provide easy navigation with `Get.to()`, `Get.back()`, and custom transitions.
- Optimize performance by updating only parts of the UI that need to be re-rendered when the state changes.

Additionally, we use **go_router** for route management in this project, providing a simpler and more scalable way to manage routing and deep linking.

## Dependencies:
- `get` for state management: `flutter pub add get`
- `go_router` for routing: `flutter pub add go_router`
